# Section 4 - Kafka Theory

## 7-7 - Topics Partitions and Offsets
### Kafka topics
**topic:** A particular stream of data within your kafka cluster. A topic in kafka is like a table in a database(without all the constraints)
- You can have as many topics as you want in your kafka cluster.
- A topic is identified by it's **name**, like: logs, purchases, twitter_tweets and trucks_gps
- these kafka topics support any kind of message formats(you can send json, avro, text file, binary and ...)
- the sequence of the messages in a topic is called a **data stream**. You make data streams through topics.
- you can't query topics, instead, to add data into a topic, use kafka producers and to read the data from the topic, use kafka consumers. But there's
no querying capability within kafka

### Partitions and offsets
- topics are split into partitions(example: 100 partitions)
- Topics are general but you can divide them into partitions. So a topic can be made of for example 100 partitions
- The messages sent to kafka topic are going to end up in these partitions and messages within each partition are going to be ordered
- data is written into partitions
- the messages in these partitions(where they are written) are getting an incrementing id and this id is called a **kafka partition offset(offset)**
- kafka topics are immutable which means once data is written into a partition it can not be changed. So we can't delete or update data in kafka, you
have to keep on writing to the partition

![](./img/7-7-1.png)

### Topic example: truck_gps
- say you have a fleet of trucks; each truck reports it's GPS position to kafka
- each truck will send a message to kafka every 20 seconds, each message will contain the truckID and the truck position(latitude and longitude)
- you can have a topic `trucks_gps` that contains the position of all trucks
- we chose to create that topic with 10 partitions(arbitrary number - we will see how choose the best value)
- once the topic is created, we have some use cases: for example:
    - we have some consumers of that topic and send it into a location dashboard to track the location of trucks in real time
    - maybe we also want to have a notification service consuming the same stream of data to send notification to customers when that delivery is close

So with kafka, multiple services are reading from the same stream of data

### Topics, partitions and offsets - important notes
- once a data is written to a partition, it **can not be changed**(immutability)
- data in kafka is kept only for a limited time(default is one week - configurable)
- offsets only have a meaning for a specific partition:
    - Offsets are repeated across partitions, so offset 3 in partition 0 doesn't represent the
    same data as offset 3 in partition 1
    - offsets are not re-used even if previous messages have been deleted
- order of messages is guaranteed only within a partition(not across partitions)
- when data is sent to kafka topic, is gonna be assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided
- you can have as many partitions as you want per topic

## 8-8 - Producers and Message Keys
### Producers
- topics hold data
- producers write data to topic(which are made of partitions, so producers write to topic partitions)
- producers know in advance to which partition they write to(and which kafka broker(which is a kafka server) has it). This means that the
producers know in advance in which partition the message is gonna be written. Some people think that kafka(the server) decides at the end which
partition data gets written to. But this is wrong, the producer decides in advance which partition to write to.
- in case of kafka broker(server) failure which would have partitions, producers will know how to automatically recover. So there's a lot of behind the
scenes magic
- we have load balancing because the producers gonna send data across all partitions based on some mechanism and this is why kafka scales, because
we have many partitions within a topic and each partition is gonna receive messages from one or more producers

### Producers: Message keys
- the message itself has self contained data, but then the producer can add a key and it's optional(can be anything string, number, binary).
- for example we have a producer that's writing to a topic with two partitions. If the **key** is null(means key is not provided in the
producer message), then the data is sent round robin and this is how we get load balancing
- if key != null then all messages that share the same key always go to the same partition(hashing strategy) in other words they will always end up being written
to the same partition. This is a property of kafka producers
- a key is typically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field(ex: truck_id). Now for example the truck_id 123 is gonna be always sent to
partition 0 and we can read data **in order** for that one truck from partition 0 and truck id 234 is always gonna be sent to partition 0. Note: Which key
ends up in which partition is made thanks to the hashing technique. For example truck_id 345, 456 will always end up in partition 1 of your topic A.

### Kafka messages anatomy
- key(can be null). It's in binary
- value(can be null but usually is not) which is the message content. In binary
- compression type. Do we want messages to be smaller? types: none, gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd
- headers(optional) list of key-value pairs
- the partition that the message is going to be sent to
- offset
- timestamp(either set by system or by user)

This message gets sent into kafka for storage.

How do these messages get created?

### Kafka message serializer
We have a kafka message serializer.

- Kafka only accepts bytes as an input from producers and sends bytes out as an output to consumers. But when we construct messages, they're
not bytes. So we're going to perform message serialization
- message serialization means transforming objects/data into bytes
- these serializers are gonna be used only on the value and key. For example the key object is 123 and value object is "hello world". So these are
not bytes just yet. Then we specify the `KeySerializer` to be an `IntegerSerializer` and kafka producer is smart enough to transform that key object(123)
through the serializer into a series of bytes and this will give us the binary representation of that key. For value object we specify a
StringSerializer and producer is gonna smart enough to transform the string into a series of bytes for our value. Now that we have key and value as binary
representations, this message is ready to be sent into kafka.
- kafka producers come with common serializers that help you do this transformation, common message serializers include:
  - string(including the JSON representation of the string)
- int, float
- avro
- protobuf

### For the curios: Kafka message key hashing
How the message keys are hashed?

- a kafka partitioner is a code logic that takes a record(message) and determines to which partition to send it into
- so when we do `.send()`, the producer partitioner logic is gonna look at the record and then assigns it to a partition and then it gets sent
by the producer into kafka
- **key hashing** is the process of determining the mapping of a key to a partition
- in the default kafka partitioner, the keys are hashed using the **murmur2 algorithm**, with the formula below for curios:
`targetPartition = Math.abs(Utils.murmur2(keyBytes) % (numPartitions - 1))`

Note: Producers are the ones who choose where the message is gonna end up thanks to the key bytes(by hashing the key)

## 9-9 - Consumers & Deserialization
### Consumers
We have serializing at producer side and deserializing at the consumer side.

- consumers implement the pull model. That means that the consumers are going to request data from the **kafka brokers(servers**) and then
they will get a response back. It's **not** the kafka broker pushing data to the consumers. Instead, it's a pull model.
- consumer read data from a topic(identified by name) - pull model
- when consumers need to read data from a partition, they will automatically know which broker(kafka server) to read from and in case a broker has a 
failure, the consumers are again very smart and they will know how to recover from this.
- data is read in order from low to high offset within **each** partition. But remember there's no ordering guarantees **across** partitions.
Because they are different partitions. The only ordering we have is within each partition. So if a consumer consumes from multiple partitions, we have
ordering for each partition, but there is no ordering across partitions.

### Consumer deserializer
Consumers need to transform received bytes into objects or data
- deserialize indicates how to transform bytes into objects/data(both key and value is gonna be in binary format after receiving)
- they are used on the key and value of the message
- the consumer has to know in advance, what is the format of your messages. For example the key is integer, so it's gonna use IntegerDeserializer to transform
the key that is bytes into an integer
- common deserializers:
  - string(including JSON)
  - int, float
  - avro
  - protobuf
- since the consumer needs to know in advance what is the expected format for your key and value, the serialization/deserialization type
must not change during a topic lifecycle(create a new topic instead - also the consumers should be re-programmed a bit). Otherwise the consumers are gonna break.
So if you want to change the data type of your topic, create a new topic instead.

## 10-10 - Consumer Groups & Consumer Offsets
### Consumer groups
- all the consumers in an application read data as a consumer group. For example we have a kafka topic with 5 partitions and then we have a
consumer group that is called `consumer-group-application` and that consumer group has 3 consumers.
- each consumer within a group(if all belong to the same group) reads from exclusive partitions. Meaning we won't have two consumers that is consuming
from the same partition. For example consumer 1 is reading from partition 0 and 1, consumer 2 is reading from partition2 and 3 and consumer 3 is
reading from partition 4. consumers read from distinct partitions. This way a group is gonna read the topic as a whole.

### Consumer groups - what if too many consumers?
What if we have more consumers in your group than partitions?

- if you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be inactive(it won't help other consumers to read from partitions, it's gonna stay
inactive)

### Multiple consumer groups on one topic
You can have multiple consumer groups on one topic. 
- in kafka it's completely acceptable to have multiple consumer groups on the same topic. Therefore we could have some partitions that will
have multiple readers(consumers), but within a consumer group, only one consumer is going to be assigned to a partition.
- to create distinct consumer groups, use the consumer property `group.id` to give a name to consumer group and then consumers will know in which
group they belong

Q: Why would you have multiple consumer groups?

Let's say we have location service and notification service reading from the same data stream of `trucks_gps`, this means we're gonna have one consumer
group per service(because we can't have two consumers that are in the same consumer, reading from the same partition, therefore we need to have two
consumer groups in this case). So one consumer group will be for the location service and another consumer group for notif service.

![](./img/10-10-1.png)

### Consumer offset
Consumer groups are even more powerful than what we think.
- in a group we can define consumer offsets. What are they? Kafka is gonna store the offsets at which a consumer group has been reading and these
offsets are going to be in a kafka topic named `__consumer_offsets`.
- the offsets committed are in kafka `topic` named `__consumer_offsets`. It has two underscores at the beginning because it's an internal kafka topic.
- when a consumer in a group has processed data received from kafka, it should **periodically** committing the offsets(the kafka broker will
write to `__consumer_offsets`, not the group itself).
- by committing the offsets we're going to be able to tell the kafka broker how far we've been successfully reading into the kafka topic
- why consumers tell broker to commit offsets? if a consumer dies and then comes back, it will be able to read back from where it left off thanks to
the committed consumer offsets. For example the broker is gonna say: hey in partition 2, it seems you have been reading up to offset 4262, then when
you restart, I will only send you data from this offset onwards.

The consumers are gonna commit offsets once in a while and when the offsets are committed, this is gonna allow the consumer to keep on reading from that
offset onwards.

### Delivery semantics for consumers
based on how and when you commit offsets, you're gonna be in one of the delivery modes(there are 3 modes).

- by default, java consumers will **automatically** commit offsets(at least once)
- if you choose to commit manually, there are 3 delivery semantics
- at least once(usually preferred)
  - offsets are committed after the message is processed
  - if the processing goes wrong, the message will be read again
  - this can result in duplicate processing of messages. Make sure your processing is idempotent(i.e. processing again the message won't impact your
  systems)
- at most once
  - offsets are committed as soon as messages are received
  - if the processing goes wrong, some messages will be lost(they won't be read again, because we have committed offsets sooner than when we're done
  processing those messages)
- exactly once
  - for kafka => kafka workflows: use the transactional API(easy with kafka streams API)
  - for kafka => external system workflows: use an **idempotent** consumer

kafka => kafka workflows means when we read from topic and then we write back to topic as a result, we can use the transactional API.

## 11-11 - Brokers and Topics
### Kafka brokers
- a kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers(servers). A broker is just a server but in kafka they're called brokers because they receive and send data.
- each broker is identified with it's id(integer)
- each broker contains only certain topic partitions. That means your data is gonna be distributed across all brokers
- after connecting to any broker(called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected(and know how to connect) to the 
entire cluster(kafka clients have smart mechanics for that named broker discovery mechanism). clients are producers or consumers.
This means you don't need to know in advance, all the brokers in your cluster, you just need to know how to connect to one broker and 
then your clients will automatically connect to the rest.
- a good number to get started is 3 brokers, but some big clusters have over 100 brokers

### Brokers and topics
The topic partitions are gonna be spread out across all brokers in whatever order.

example of topic-a with 3 partitions and topic-b with 2 partitions and 3 brokers

As you can see in example, the partitions(data) is distributed and it's normal for example the broker 103 doesn't have any topic-b data(any partitions of it).

So data or partitions that have data are gonna be distributed across all brokers and this is what makes kafka scale(horizontal). Because the more
partitions and more brokers we add, the more the data is gonna be spread out across our entire cluster.

Note: The brokers always don't have all the data(like broker 103 in the example below).
![](./img/11-11-1.png)

### Kafka broker discovery
- every kafka broker is also called a **bootstrap server**
- that means that you only need to connect to one broker and the kafka clients will know how to be connected to the entire cluster(smart clients)
So for example kafka client will initiate a connection into broker 101 as well as a metadata request and then broker 101 will return a list of
all the brokers in the cluster(and more data such as which broker has which partition). Then the kafka client thanks to this list of all brokers,
is gonna be able to connect to the broker it needs(to produce or consume data)
- each broker is smart and it knows about all brokers, topics and partitions(metadata of your kafka cluster)

![](./img/11-11-2.png)

## 12-12 - Topic Replication
### Topic replication factor
- topics should have a replication factor > 1 (usually between 2 and 3). Note: When you're developing on your local machine, topics can
have a replication factor of one. But usually when you're in production(having a real kafka cluster), you need to set a replication factor greater
than one, usually between 2 and 3 and most commonly at 3.
- This way, if a broker is down(a kafka server is stopped for maintenance or for technical issues), then another broker can serve the data because it
has a copy of the data to serve and receive
- **example:** topic-a with 2 partitions and replication factor of 2. Now we have 3 kafka brokers and we're gonna place partition 0 of topic-A
onto broker 101, partition 1 of topic-a on broker 102. Until now, we have place the initial partitions without replications. Now because
we have a replication factor of 2, then we're gonna have a copy of partition 0 onto broker 102 with a replication mechanism(so partition 0 is on both
broker 101 and 102) and a copy of partition 1 on broker 103(so partition 1 is on both broker 102 and 103) with again, a replication mechanism.
**The number of partitions was 2 and the replication factor was 2, so the total number of partitions gonna be 4(2 * 2). We can see that the brokers
are replicating data from other brokers.**
![](./img/12-12-1.png)

Q: Look at the above pic: What if we lose broker 102?

Answer: Well we have broker 101 and 103 still up and they can still serve the data. So partition 0 and 1 are still available within our cluster and
this is why we have replication factor.
![](./img/12-12-2.png)

### Concept of leader for a partition
- at any time only **ONE** broker can be a leader for a given partition
- the rule: **producers can only send data to the broker that is the leader of a partition**
- the other brokers will replicate the data
- therefore, each partition has one leader and multiple ISR(in-sync replica). If the data is replicated fast enough, then each replica
is going to be called an ISR.

In image below, the leaders for partitions are specified. Broker 101 is the leader of partition 0 and broker 102 is the leader of partition 1.
![](./img/12-12-3.png)

### default producer & consumer behaviour with leaders
- by default(default behavior with leaders), the kafka producers can only write to the leader broker for a partition. For example:
if the producer wants to send data to partition 0 and we have a leader and an ISR for partition 0, then the producer knows that it should only
send the data into the broker that is the leader of that partition.
- by default, kafka consumers will read only from the leader broker for a partition. So replicas of that partition, are replicas just for the sake
of replicating data and in case the leader broker goes down, then one of them can become the new leader and receive data from the producers and
serve data for the consumers.

These were the default behaviors.
![](./img/12-12-4.png)

### Kafka consumers replica fetching(kafka v2.4+)
- since kafka 2.4, it's possible to configure consumers to read from the closes replica. Why? This may help to improve latency, because maybe the
consumer is really close to the replica and also it helps decrease network cost if we're using the cloud. Because if things are in the same
data center, then you have little to no cost.
![](./img/12-12-5.png)

## 13-13 - Producer Acknowledgements & Topic Durability
### Producer Acknowledgements(acks)
We have producers sending data to brokers and we know brokers have topic partitions.

- producers can choose to receive acknowledgements of data writes. That means to have the confirmation from the kafka broker that the write did
successfully happen.
- We have three settings:
  - `acks=0`: producer won't wait or ask for an acknowledgement(possible data loss, because if the broker goes down, the producer won't know about it)
  - `acks=1`: producer will wait for leader(of a partition) acknowledgement(limited data loss)
  - `acks=all`: leader + replicas acknowledgement(no data loss). Means we require the leader as well as all replicas(in sync replicas) to acknowledge
  the writes which is going to guarantee of no data loss under certain circumstances.

### Kafka topic durability
- if we have a topic with the replication factor of 3, then the topic(topic data) can withstand two brokers loss
- as a rule, for a replication factor of N, you can permanently lose up to N - 1 brokers and still recover your data(still have a copy of your
data somewhere in your cluster)

Note: The image for this slide is wrong. If we have replication factor of 3, we would need 4 brokers.

If replication factor is 3, we need 4 brokers and ... .

## 14-14 - Zookeeper
- zookeeper manages brokers(keeps list of them)
- zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions. Whenever a broker goes down we need to perform a leader election to choose the
new leader for partitions(or some of them) and zookeeper is going to help with this process.
- zookeeper sends notifications to kafka brokers in case of changes(e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc...). So zookeeper
has a lot of kafka components metadata
- kafka 2.x can't work without zookeeper. So you can't launch kafka without launching zookeeper
- kafka 3.x can work without zookeeper(KIP-500) - using kafka raft instead. So we can run kafka work on its own without zookeeper, it's called
the kafka raft(kraft) mechanism instead.
- kafka 4.x will not have zookeeper
- zookeeper by design operates with an odd number of servers(1, 3, 5, 7). So you either have 1 zookeeper, or 3 or 5 or 7(never more than 7 usually).
- zookeeper also has leaders(writes) and the rest of the servers are followers(reads)
- zookeeper does **NOT** store consumer offsets with kafka > v 0.10. This is old information: kafka consumers in the old versions of kafka,
used to store consumer offsets on zookeeper. But now as you know, they store consumer offsets on the internal kafka topics named `consumer_offsets`.
So zookeeper does not hold any consumer data starting with kafka `v 0.10` .

### zookeeper cluster(ensemble)
Brokers are connected to zookeeper and that's how they get their metadata.
![](./img/14-14-1.png)

### Should you use zookeeper?
- with kafka brokers(are you managing kafka brokers)?
  - yes, until kafka 4.0 is out while waiting for kafka without zookeeper to be production-ready. So you shouldn't use kafka without zookeeper in production.
  But we'll see how to start kafka without zookeeper to play with it. But this is not production ready yet.
- with kafka clients?
  - over time, the kafka clients and CLI have been migrated to leverage the brokers as a (the only) connection endpoint instead of zookeeper. But before,
  we used to connect our producers, clients(consumers) and administration client to zookeeper.
  - since kafka 0.10, consumers store offsets in kafka and zookeeper and must not connect zookeeper as it's deprecated.
  - since kafka 2.2, the `kafka-topics.sh` CLI command references kafka brokers and not zookeeper for topic management(creating, deletion etc...) and the
  zookeeper CLI argument is deprecated.
  - all the APIs and commands that were previously leveraging zookeeper are migrated to use kafka instead, so that when clusters are migrated
  to be without zookeeper(when we're going to have kafka without zookeeper), the change is invisible to clients.
  - zookeeper is also less secure than kafka and therefore zookeeper ports should only be opened to allow traffic from kafka brokers and not kafka
  clients. So we should protect zookeeper if you use it, to only accept connections from kafka brokers and not from kafka clients
  - therefore, to be a great modern-day kafka developer, never ever use zookeeper as a configuration in your kafka clients and other
  programs that connect to kafka. So do not connect to zookeeper in your programs, only connect to kafka.

## 15-15 - Kafka KRaft Removing Zookeeper
### About kafka kRaft
- in 2020, the apache kafka project started to work to remove the zookeeper dependency from it(KIP-500)
- why? Because zookeeper shows scaling issues when kafka clusters have > 100,000 partitions
- by removing zookeeper, apache kafka can
  - scale to millions of partitions and becomes easier to maintain and set-up
  - improve stability, makes it easier to monitor, support and administer
  - single security model for the whole system
  - single process to start with kafka
  - faster controller shutdown and recovery time
- kafka 3.x now implements the raft protocol(KRaft) in order to replace zookeeper
  - kraft is not production ready yet, see: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blobl/trunk/config/kraft/README.md

We will learn how to start kafka in kraft mode.

### kafka KRaft architecture
Look at the left side: with zookeeper we have that left arch with for example 3 zookeepers managing 3 kafka brokers.

Right arch: With the KRaft mode, we're only going to have 3 brokers, one of them being designated as the quorum leader to replace the zookeeper function

![](./img/15-15-1.png)

### KRaft performance improvements
As we can see, the controlled shutdown using KRaft mode is much lower and the recovery time if the shutdown was not done well, is also much lower
than with zookeeper.

So KRaft has a lot of benefits.

## 16-16 - Theory Roundup
### Theory roundup we've looked at all the kafka concepts
A kafka cluster can be made of multiple brokers. For example in img, we have 9 brokers in our cluster.

Within the cluster, we have topics, partitions, replication, partition leader and in-sync replicas and kafka internal offsets topic.

Producers: They take data from the source system or ... and then they send data into apache kafka.

Round robin: data is distributed across all partitions in a topic evenly.

Key-based ordering: When we specify a key, then the same key is gonna end up in the same partition 

Consumers store offsets into `consumer_offsets` topic.

Note: Currently a kafka cluster is managed by zookeeper where there is leader-follower concept in zookeeper as well as broker management and 
metadata management.

The community is transitioning from using zookeeper to using just kafka cluster in KRaft mode.

# Section 3 - Kafka Fundamentals

## 6-3 - Kafka Fundamentals
In this first learning block, we are going through Kafka 101.

We'll have a very necessary all-theory section, during which we'll learn all the fundamentals of Kafka

We'll then go ahead and set up Kafka on our computers

We'll spend a lot of time learning how to use the Kafka CLI

We'll write some Java Code to create our first Producers and Consumers

By the end of this learning block, you'll be "proficient" with Kafka.

Hope you're ready, let's get started!

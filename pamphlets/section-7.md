In the next lecture, do not run the command to DELETE topics

Because of a bug here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194, it doesn't work. I'm actively working with the Kafka Dev team to see if I can get this fixed.

In the meantime, please do not delete topics. Otherwise, your Kafka will crash and you won't be able to do the tutorial.

Thanks
